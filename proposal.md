Proposal: NeuralTrace – AI-Powered
Memory Assistant for Cognitive Disorders
1. Introduction
Cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer’s disease, dementia, and short-term memory impairments
significantly affect the quality of life for millions of individuals worldwide. Patients often struggle with
remembering daily tasks, important events, medications, and personal information, which can lead
to stress, dependence on caregivers, and reduced independence.
This project proposes the development of NeuralTrace, an AI-powered memory assistant
designed to help individuals with cognitive disorders manage memory and daily tasks. The system
will provide personalized reminders, task management, and
AI-driven recommendations to support patients in their day-to-day lives while reducing the
burden on caregivers.
2. Objectives
The primary objectives of NeuralTrace are:
● To assist individuals with memory impairments in managing daily routines and important
tasks.
● To provide reminders for medications, appointments, and events through multiple
notification channels.
● To support simplified interaction for users with limited digital literacy.
● To allow caregiver integration for remote monitoring and support.
● To enhance independence and quality of life for individuals with cognitive disorders.
3. Problem Statement
Individuals with cognitive impairments face challenges in remembering essential activities, which
can result in missed medications, forgotten appointments, and increased caregiver dependence.
Existing solutions (basic reminder apps, calendars) lack personalization, adaptability, and caregiver
integration. There is a need for an AI-driven, user-friendly, and accessible system that supports
patients in managing memory-related challenges effectively.
4. Proposed Solution
NeuralTrace will be an AI-powered web/mobile platform that helps patients organize and recall
information in real-time. Key features include:
● Smart Reminders: Notifications for medications, appointments, and daily tasks (with
snooze and reschedule options).
● Memory Journal: A digital space for storing important notes and photos to
aid recall.
● Caregiver Dashboard: Remote monitoring for caregivers to check patient activities and
receive alerts.
● Adaptive AI Suggestions: Recommendations based on user habits (e.g., reminding about
hydration, exercise, or rest).
● Multi-Device Support: Accessible via web app, mobile, and smart speakers.
5. Key Features
1. Daily Task Manager – Input tasks/events with deadlines and recurring schedules.
2. Medication & Health Reminders – Alerts for dosage times, refills, and doctor visits.
3. Memory Journal – Store notes and images for personal recall.
5. Caregiver Integration – Shared access for caregivers to monitor tasks and receive
notifications.
6. AI Personalization – Adaptive reminders based on usage history and user needs.
6. Technology Stack
● Frontend: React (Web) / Flutter (Mobile) with TailwindCSS for UI.
Backend: Firebase or Supabase (authentication, database, notifications).
● AI Layer: Python (FastAPI/Flask) for personalization & scheduling logic.
● Notifications: Firebase Cloud Messaging, Email, and SMS (via free APIs like Twilio trial).
● Hosting: Vercel/Netlify for frontend, Firebase Cloud Functions for backend.
7. Methodology
1. Requirement Gathering – Interviews with students, families, or caregivers to define needs.
2. System Design – Architecture diagrams, UI/UX prototypes, and database schema.
3. Core Development
○ Reminders & Scheduling system
○ Memory journal & notes storage
○ Caregiver dashboard
○ AI-based personalization
4. Integration – Notification services.
5. Testing – Usability testing with sample users and caregivers.
6. Evaluation – Measure effectiveness in improving memory management.
9. Expected Outcomes
● A functional AI-powered memory assistant accessible on web/mobile.
● Improved independence for patients with cognitive disorders.
● Reduced caregiver burden through monitoring and alerts.
● A scalable system with potential real-world healthcare applications.
11. Risks & Mitigation
● Data Privacy: Sensitive health data requires protection → Mitigation: End-to-end
encryption, user consent, and anonymized testing data.
● Digital Literacy Issues: Some users may struggle with apps → Mitigation: Simplified UI
and simplified UI.
● Overdependence: Users may rely too much on the app → Mitigation: Encourage caregiver
integration and balance AI use.
12. Conclusion
NeuralTrace offers an innovative solution to assist individuals with cognitive disorders by
combining AI-driven task management, memory journaling, and caregiver integration. The system is
feasible using free/low-cost tools and can significantly improve independence, well-being, and
quality of life. With further development, NeuralTrace has the potential to evolve into a
healthcare-supportive application with real-world impact.
